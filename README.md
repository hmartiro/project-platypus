Here is the abstract:

This study aims to predict a user's relationships with his or her contacts
based solely on the words used in electronic communications between them.
Software was created that reads in bulk exported email data and builds a
comprehensive graph database of people, the words communicated between them,
and their relationships to each other. Several stages of preprocessing and
feature selection were applied, and then various classifiers were shown to
effectively predict relationships using 10-fold cross validation. Logistic
regression showed 5.9% testing error on a sample set of 3000 emails and 309
contacts. The study shows promising results and suggests future work that
incorporates message meta-data, other mediums of communication like text messaging,
and larger data sets would further improve results.
